                        A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval, storage, and
                        manipulation. It's crucial in technology as it serves as a central repository for storing and
                        managing structured data, enabling efficient data access, retrieval, and manipulation for
                        various applications.

                        SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables and use Structured Query
                        Language (SQL) for querying and managing data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are
                        non-relational and offer flexible schema design, horizontal scalability, and support for
                        unstructured data.

                        <strong>ACID</strong> stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four key properties ensuring reliability and consistency of transactions in a database system. Atomicity ensures that a transaction is either fully completed or fully aborted, Consistency ensures that data remains consistent before and after the transaction, Isolation ensures transactions occur independently, and Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent even in the event of system failure.

                        Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It helps minimize data anomalies, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, and ensures data integrity by breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables.

                        A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and ensures data integrity. A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. A unique key constraint ensures that values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across the table.

                        Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They provide quick access to rows based on the values of one or more columns, significantly reducing the time required for searching and filtering data.

                        A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. It follows the ACID properties and ensures data consistency and integrity. Transactions typically consist of operations such as reading data, modifying data, or both, and are executed either entirely or not at all.

                        A clustered index determines the physical order of data rows in a table, and there can be only one clustered index per table. In contrast, a non-clustered index does not alter the physical order of the table and creates a separate structure to store index keys, allowing for multiple non-clustered indexes per table.

                        Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The various normal forms include First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), and Fourth Normal Form (4NF), each addressing specific types of data redundancy and dependency.

                        Stored procedures are precompiled sets of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed repeatedly without recompilation. They enhance performance, security, and maintainability by encapsulating complex logic and reducing network traffic. Triggers are database objects that automatically execute in response to certain events, such as insertions, updates, or deletions on a table, and are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and audit changes.
