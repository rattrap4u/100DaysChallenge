 What is SQL?
Structured Query Language, or SQL (pronounced "squeel" by the in-crowd), is the primary programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases. SQL can perform various operations such as creating, updating, reading, and deleting records within a database.


Assignment
I have provided a simple SQL statement for you that retrieves some records from a table. However there isn't a people table, the table in our database is called users. Fix the bug by changing people to users within the SELECT statement.

================================
SELECT * FROM USERS;
================================

SQL Select Statement
Let's write our own SQL statement from scratch! A SELECT statement is the most common operation in SQL - often called a "query". SELECT retrieves data from one or more tables. Standard SELECT statements do not alter the state of the database.

SELECT id from users;
Copy icon
Select a single field
A SELECT statement begins with the keyword SELECT followed by the fields you want to retrieve.

SELECT id from users;
Copy icon
Select multiple fields
If you want to select more than one field you can specify multiple fields separated by commas.

SELECT id, name from users;
Copy icon
Select all fields
If you want to select every field in a record you can use the shorthand * syntax.

SELECT * from users;
Copy icon
After specifying fields, you need to indicate which table you want to pull the records from using the from statement followed by the name of the table. We'll talk more about tables later, but for now, you can think about them like structs or objects. For example, the users table might have 3 fields:

id
name
balance
And finally, all statements end with a semi-colon ;.

Assignment
The state of our CashPal users table is as follows:

id	name	age	balance	is_admin
1	John Smith	28	450	1
2	Darren Walker	27	200	1
3	Jane Morris	33	496.24	0
It's very common to write queries that only return specific portions of data from a table. Our HR team has requested a report asking for all the names and balances of all of our users.

Write a query that retrieves all of the names and balances from the users table.


========================================================
SELECT NAME, BALANCE FROM USERS;
========================================================

One way in which SQLite is a bit different is that it stores Boolean values as integers - the integers 0 and 1.

0 = false
1 = true

SELECT ID, NAME, IS_ADMIN,
    CASE 
        WHEN is_admin = 1 THEN 'true' 
        WHEN is_admin = 0 THEN 'false' 
    END AS is_admin_flag
  FROM USERS;

~~~~~~~4.~~~~~~   SQL vs NoSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

the main differences between a SQL and NoSQL databases are:

1. NoSQL databases are usually non-relational, SQL databases are usually relational (we'll talk more about what this means later).
2. SQL databases usually have a defined schema, NoSQL databases usually have dynamic schema.
3. SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL databases have a variety of different storage methods, such as document, key-value, graph, wide-column, and more.
